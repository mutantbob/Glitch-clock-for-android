ANDROID MARKET

I haven't bothered to figure out how to upload this to the Android
market yet.





BINARY INSTALL

Get the Android SDK from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Download a pre-compiled .apk from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

http://www.purplefrog.com/~thoth/glitch-clock/

Connect your phone to the computer using a USB cable and

$ <ANDROID_SDK>/platform-tools/adb install -r GlitchClock-debug.apk





COMPILE FROM SOURCE

Get the Android SDK from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html


Get the Glitch SDK from https://github.com/tinyspeck/glitch-android-sdk ; use 

git clone https://github.com/tinyspeck/glitch-android-sdk.git

to check out their source next to the Glitch-clock-for-android/ directory.


To prepare the project for building :

$ cd Glitch-clock-for-android/android
$ android update project --path . --name GlitchClock

You should not have to do that again unless something changes
drastically in the project.

Every time you change the source and want to build a new version and
install it on your phone:

$ ant clean debug
    #connect your phone to the computer via a USB cable for this next step
$ adb install -r bin/GlitchClock-debug.apk


The "clean" is not usually necessary, but when you're adding resources,
sometimes android changes the constants in the R.java file and classes
compiled against the old version of R.java sprout bugs and crash.





AFTER INSTALLATION

Once it is installed on the phone you can place the widget on the home
screen of your phone by pressing your finger on an empty cell and
holding it until a menu appears.  One of the menu options is Widgets.
Select the Glitch Clock from the list.  The glitch clock takes up 2
side-by-side cells, so if you don't have enough space, the phone won't
let you place it.
